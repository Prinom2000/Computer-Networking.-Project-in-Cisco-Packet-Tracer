# Computer-Networking.-Project-in-Cisco-Packet-Tracer

I did my best to finish the project perfectly. In this project, I created a complete model of a 
complicated network using things like computers, routers, switches, and wireless routers. All these 
devices could talk to each other across the network without any problems. I also set up a special 
server to show the Universityâ€™s website page. I even changed how the website looks using a special 
code called HTML. I added a system that gives out unique numbers to all the computers when they 
need one (that's called an IP address).
I learned a lot from this course & project
